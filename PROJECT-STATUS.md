# PROJECT STATUS

> Workflow/gate mirror only. Not a Source of Truth.

## Repository Bootstrap

- **Repository state:** BOOTSTRAP COMPLETE — DELIVERY IMPLEMENTATION / REVIEW LOOP ACTIVE
- **Product/System Source of Truth:** `docs/website-modernization-docs/`
- **System Blueprint:** `docs/website-modernization-docs/current/10-system-blueprint.md` — FROZEN v1.1
- **Spec Kit control layer:** INSTALLED AS REPOSITORY FILES
- **Canonical Constitution:** ESTABLISHED — `.specify/memory/constitution.md` v1.0.0
- **Spec Kit runtime/integrations:** VERIFIED — Specify CLI 0.16.4; Codex + Claude integrations OK

## Planned Delivery

- **Delivery:** 001-application-foundation — Application Foundation & Development Runtime
- **Delivery Context:** `docs/spec-context/001-application-foundation.md`
- **Delivery Context state:** READY  <!-- UNSET | DRAFT | READY | STALE -->
- **Status:** HUMAN GATE — T029 INDEPENDENT REVIEW PASS

## Active Feature Mirror

- **Runtime resolution after `specify`:** `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` override when set; otherwise `.specify/feature.json`
- **Resolved from:** explicit `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY=specs/001-application-foundation` override;
  `.specify/feature.json` is absent
- **Feature directory:** `specs/001-application-foundation`
- **Verified:** YES — matches the planned Delivery and Delivery Context

## Workflow Gate

- **Current phase:** IMPLEMENTATION / REVIEW LOOP
- **Current review result:** PASS — T029, including T029-B01–T029-B03 corrective closure
- **Phase status:** T029 AWAITS PRODUCT OWNER HUMAN GATE — T030+ UNAUTHORIZED
- **Previous completed scope:** T028 — supervised native Development startup and bounded whole-
  foundation readiness, including accepted closure of T028-B01–T028-B05
- **Next valid action:** Product Owner Human Gate — accept or reject T029; do not authorize T030 or
  advance the Delivery automatically
- **Blocking issues:** NONE for T029 independent review
- **Review evidence:** Corrective tip `969992645ebbe9948131a64ef6b0b9378894b829` is fetchable and
  follows replayed T029 implementation commit `e9da8ff52db8992ea8abb51c9732e24d556bb1eb`
  from rework authorization `8518f9f774ca4c15995f41f1b759ef859d4dcbeb`. Exact base-to-tip changes are
  `scripts/foundation-operations.mjs`, `scripts/foundation-operations.test.ts`, and `package.json`;
  `scripts/foundation-operations.d.mts` is identical to the authorized base. Independent verification:
  T029-B01 2/2; T029-B02 2/2; focused restart 1/1; full operations 54 passed / 40 expected T030–T031
  stub failures; TypeScript retains only the four established later-task missing-export errors;
  diff check and prohibited-marker inspection are clean. Unconditional exact Compose stop closes
  T029-B01; unreadable/missing PID identity evidence now fails closed without signalling, closing
  T029-B02; the unauthorized declaration-file delta is absent, closing T029-B03. The named-volume
  deletion path remains absent; T030+ behavior, dependencies, lockfile, manifests, and Product scope
  are unchanged.
- **Non-blocking notes:** Independent npm used Node 24.11.0 with npm 11.6.1, below the repository's
  npm 12 engine pin; this did not affect the focused unit results, but full prerequisite acceptance
  still requires the approved npm version. The failed provider response reported a reset time of
  `2026-08-25 03:23:56`; this is diagnostic timing, not proof that capacity is available.
- **Reconciliation evidence:** Human-authorized non-rewriting merge
  `b16c06905f97566a279283df285da1fd3cfb2573` joins canonical governance head
  `5d2967cf1d536214c2ffea3fdd2877c48904ca5c` and accepted T028 implementation tip
  `ec998583ab687b1db4b5b8355c51479c394f505e` from exact merge base
  `ad5b7a5047a58e8b0e70bb670407fe307f7aa0e8`. The accepted tip is an ancestor of the merged head;
  its nine implementation files are byte-identical to the accepted tip; `PROJECT-STATUS.md` remains
  the canonical governance side; T028-B01–T028-B05 remain closed; T029+ remain unauthorized.

## Authorized Implementation

- **Task / Scope:** NONE — Product Owner Human Gate after T029 PASS; T030+ unauthorized
- **Runtime:** NONE
- **Required references:** NONE
- **Expected verification:** NONE
- **Authorization state:** NONE  <!-- NONE | AUTHORIZED | REWORK | SUPERSEDED -->

## Rules

- Do not create application code merely to make the repository look initialized.
- Before first `specify`, verify `specify version` and `specify integration status` on the real development machine.
- Reconcile `bootstrap/constitution.proposed.md` through `/speckit.constitution`; do not copy it directly to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
- Before first `specify`, this file selects the planned Delivery and points to its Delivery Context.
- Do not run `specify` until the Delivery Context state is `READY`.
- After `specify`, mirror the feature resolved by Spec Kit; never override runtime feature state.
- Treat a conflicting pre-existing `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` as a blocker; do not silently set/unset it to reconcile status.
- Codex updates this file after each phase/review gate.
- Clear task authorization after PASS or supersession.
- Do not use this file as a changelog.
